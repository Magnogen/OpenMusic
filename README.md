# Open Music 🎶
I love music. I also love Open Source code, something about the transparency I think. 🤔

I thought I could merge the two together, kind of like a collection of music and sound effects that anyone can dip in to at any time for their projects. So yeah, please feel free to do so! 😊

💬 If you want something specific, and it's not here already, go ahead and make an Issue and ask for what you'd like - don't worry, I won't take it personally! (It's what it's there for!)

⏲️ This project is in its early stages, so there isn't a lot of stuff yet, but I hope to add more as time goes on, including some longer pieces of music and things too! 

I must ask though, that if you decide to use any of these, please do include the following in your credits, substituting thing in [brackets], thank you!

⚖️ Crediting (copy and paste this)
```
Magnogen/OpenMusic:[file name]
```

Resulting in something like:
```
Magnogen/OpenMusic:8bit_lazers
```

You can put these anywhere, just make sure it's easily visible
