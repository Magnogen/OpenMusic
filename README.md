# Open Music 🎶
I love music. I also love Open Source code, something about the transparency I think. 🤔

I thought I could merge the two together, kind of like a collection of music and sound effects that anyone can dip in to at any time for their projects. So yeah, please feel free to do so! 😊

💬 If you want something specific, and it's not here already, go ahead and make an Issue and ask for what you'd like - don't worry, I won't take it personally! (It's what it's there for!)

⏲️ This project is in its early stages, so there isn't a lot of stuff yet, but I hope to add more as time goes on, including some longer pieces of music and things too!
